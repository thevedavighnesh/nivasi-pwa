# 🔧 Payment Recording - Column Name Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Error:** `column "payment_date" of relation "payments" does not exist`

**Cause:** The database schema uses `paid_date` but the API was using `payment_date`

---

## 🛠️ Changes Made

### **1. Updated Record Payment API**
**File:** `__create/index.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
INSERT INTO payments (tenant_id, amount, payment_date, payment_method, status, notes, created_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, NOW())
```

**After:**
```typescript
INSERT INTO payments (tenant_id, amount, due_date, paid_date, payment_method, status, notes, created_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, NOW())
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Changed `payment_date` → `paid_date`
- ✅ Added `due_date` column (required by schema)
- ✅ Changed status from `'completed'` → `'paid'` (matches schema constraint)

---

### **2. Updated Payment History API**
**File:** `__create/index.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
ORDER BY payment_date DESC
```

**After:**
```typescript
ORDER BY paid_date DESC
```

---

### **3. Updated Frontend Display**
**File:** `src/app/tenant/dashboard/page.jsx`

**Changed:**
```javascript
payment.paid_date || payment.payment_date  // Fallback for compatibility
```

---

## 📊 Database Schema Reference

From `database/schema.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS payments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  due_date DATE NOT NULL,        -- ← This is the correct column
  paid_date DATE,                 -- ← This is the correct column
  payment_method VARCHAR(100),
  transaction_id VARCHAR(255),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'paid', 'overdue', 'cancelled')),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ `due_date` - When payment is due
- ✅ `paid_date` - When payment was actually made
- ✅ `status` - Must be one of: pending, paid, overdue, cancelled

## 🧪 Testing

3. Select tenant
4. Fill in details
5. Submit

**Expected:**

### **Test 3: Check Database**
```sql
SELECT * FROM payments ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Columns:**
