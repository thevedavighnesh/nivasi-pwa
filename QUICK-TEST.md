## 🔧 Quick Database Checks

### **Check 1: Payment Exists**

```

**Expected:** 1 row with amount = 25000.00

---

### **Check 2: Tenant Assignment**
```sql
SELECT * FROM tenants WHERE id = 2;
```

**Expected:** 1 row with:
- `id = 2`
- `user_id = X` (some number)
- `property_id = Y` (some number)

---

### **Check 3: Tenant User**
```sql
SELECT u.id, u.email, u.name, t.id as tenant_assignment_id
FROM users u
JOIN tenants t ON u.id = t.user_id
WHERE t.id = 2;
```

**This gives you:**
- User email (to log in)
